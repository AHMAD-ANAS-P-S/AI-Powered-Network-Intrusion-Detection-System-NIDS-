# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview
This project is an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System prototype developed for academic demonstration.  
It uses Machine Learning to classify simulated network traffic as Normal or Intrusion.

## Features
- Machine Learning–based intrusion detection
- Random Forest classifier
- Live traffic simulation using user inputs
- Streamlit-based interactive dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run Application
streamlit run nids_main.py

Access the app at:
http://localhost:8501

## Notes
- The system currently uses simulated data.
- Real-world datasets like CIC-IDS2017 can be integrated in future work.
